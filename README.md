# LendingClub-Loan-Prediction
Prediction of loan payment.

About:
-----
LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California. It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. LendingClub is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.

I used a subset of the LendingClub DataSet obtained from Kaggle and built a model to predict whether the customer will fully pay back their loan or will be charged off.

Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), I built a model that can predict wether or not a borrower will pay back their loan. This way in the future when LendingClub get a new potential customer they can assess whether or not they are likely to pay back the loan.
